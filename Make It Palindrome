You are given an array ‘A’ of length ‘N’ consisting only of positive integers. Your task is to make the given array a palindrome by using a minimum number of operations. 
In one operation, you can select two adjacent indexes and merge them by adding their values. After every operation, the length of the array decreases by one.

Note: An array of length ‘1’ is a palindrome.
For example:
Let’s say the array ‘A’ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then after merging indexes 2 and 3, the array ‘A’ will look like [1, 5, 4, 5].


T.C => O(N)
S.C => O(N)
