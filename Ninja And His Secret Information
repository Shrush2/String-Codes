Ninja has recently joined the FBI. Ninja got some secret information ‘SECRET_INFORMATION’ which he wants to share with his team. But he can not send this information directly because of the hackers and security threats they pose.
So Ninja decides to encode this ‘SECRET_INFORMATION’ and then send the encoded ‘SECRET_INFORMATION’ to his team members. This way, only his team members can decode this information and thus share it safely.
As Ninja is busy extracting the ‘SECRET_INFORMATION, he asks you for help.
Can you help Ninja and his friends with encoding and decoding the ‘SECRET_INFORMATION’?

1. The ‘SECRET_INFORMATION’ may contain any possible character out of 256 valid ASCII characters.
2. While decoding the ‘SECRET_INFORMATION’ do not use class members / global/static variables.
3. Do not use any inbuilt library method/function for decoding the ‘SECRET_INFORMATION’.

input :- Hi!
encode :- Kl$
decode :- Hi!
output :- Transmission successful
