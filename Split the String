You are given a string ‘S’ consisting of lower-case English alphabets, find the number of good splits.
Splitting a string ‘S’ into two non-empty strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’ is called good if the number of unique characters in strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’ is equal.

For Example :
If string S is equal to “abadaa”.

Then S can be split in the following ways:
X = “a” and Y = “badaa”, string X has 1 unique character and Y has 3 unique characters.
X = “ab” and Y = “adaa”, string X has 2 unique characters and Y has 2 unique characters.[GOOD SPLIT]
X = “aba” and Y = “daa”, string X has 2 unique characters and Y has 2 unique characters.[GOOD SPLIT]
X = “abad” and Y = “aa”, string X has 3 unique characters and Y has 1 unique character.
X = “abada” and Y = “a”, string X has 3 unique characters and Y has 1 unique character.
Therefore we will return value 2 as we are able to find 2 good splits.


T.C => O(N)
S.C => O(N)
