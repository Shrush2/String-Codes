You are provided with the two strings named X and Y respectively. Y has its own specific order and has no repeating characters. Your task is to arrange the characters of the first string i.e. 
X in such a way that the order of characters in X is exactly the same as in Y, which means if ‘d’ occurs after ‘c’ in Y then it should also occur after ‘c’ in X ( obviously if X has ‘d’ and ‘c’ 
as characters in it ). All you have to do is, convert string X in the specific order with respect to string Y.

Note :
Both the strings have only lowercase English alphabets. 
There may be more than one correct solution, you have to return any one of the possible solutions.


Sample Input 1:
acabd
abc

Sample Output 1:
aabcd

Explanation of Sample Input 1:
String Y has ‘a’ first then ‘b’ and then ‘c’ and therefore string X must be ordered as ‘aabcd’ to keep the respective order of characters same as in string Y.
Other possible answers are: ‘daabc’ , ‘adabc’ , ‘aadbc’, ‘aabdc’.

S.C => O(N)
