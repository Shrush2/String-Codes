Ninja and his friend playing a game in which his friend gave him a string ‘STR’ that can contain spaces and a List/Array ‘WORDS’ which is of type string containing ‘N’ strings of words. Ninja’s
task is to count the occurrences of all the words in ‘STR’.
For Example:

‘STR’ = “i am a Ninja”, ‘N’ = 3 and ‘WORDS[]’ = [“Ninja”,”a”,”am”]. Then the output should be [1,1,1]. Because the occurrence of “Ninja” in ‘STR’ is 1 and the occurrence of “a” in ‘STR’ is 1.
Similarly occurrence of “am” is 1.

T.C => O(N + L)
S.C => O(N)
