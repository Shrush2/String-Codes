You are given a string ‘STR’ consisting of lowercase English alphabets. Your take is to find out the minimum number of character deletions required such that
each character in the final string has a unique frequency.


Sample Input 1 :
babccbc

Sample Output 1 :
1

Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
Test Case 1 :
The frequency of ‘a’ is 1, of ‘b’ is 3 and of ‘c’ is 3. Therefore after deletion of one character of either ‘b’ or ‘c’ makes the frequencies 1,2 and 3.


T.C => O(N)
S.C => O(N)
