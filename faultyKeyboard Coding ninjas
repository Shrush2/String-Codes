Ninja has an old keyboard, which is now a piece of junk, but Ninja still loves it.
There is a major problem with the keyboard, pressing a single key can type the same character multiple times. This sometimes results in incorrect text being typed.
You are given two strings ‘Expected’ and ‘Typed’, you need to tell if the actual text was typed correctly or not. The text is typed correctly if some characters were long pressed 
(typed multiple times) while typing the ‘Expected’ text. Print “true” if the actual text was typed correctly, else print “false”.

For Example :
If Typed = “aaabcc” and Expected = “abc”

Then, while trying to type “abc” one might long press ‘a’ and that would result in typing three consecutive a’s. This if followed by correctly pressing ‘b’ once and in the end he might long press 
‘c’ resulting in typing it twice, the resulting text typed in this case is equal to “aaabcc” and therefore we will return “true”.
